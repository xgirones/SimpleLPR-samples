## What is SimpleLPR?

SimpleLPR is a professional-grade library that automatically detects and reads vehicle license plates in images and video streams. With over 10 years of development and hundreds of production deployments, it provides:

- üéØ **85-95% accuracy** under typical conditions
- üåç **Support for ~90 countries** with region-specific templates  
- üöÄ **High-performance** multi-threaded processing
- üìπ **Real-time video** analysis with temporal tracking
- üîß **Simple API** that just works

## What's in This Repository?

This repository contains ready-to-run examples showcasing SimpleLPR's capabilities:

### üìÅ Sample Applications

#### Comprehensive Examples
The repository covers all major SimpleLPR features through practical examples:
- Single image analysis

### üéØ Perfect for Learning

Each example includes detailed comments explaining:
- How to initialize the SimpleLPR engine
- Country-specific configuration
- Image and video processing workflows
- Result interpretation
- Best practices for production use

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **SimpleLPR SDK** - [60-day evaluation available](https://www.warelogic.com)
- **Operating System** - Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 20.04+ (x64)
- **Development Tools**:
  - .NET: Visual Studio 2019+ or .NET SDK
  - Python: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

### üîµ Running .NET Samples

#### Using Visual Studio
1. Open any `.csproj` (C#) or `.vbproj` (VB.NET) file in Visual Studio 2019 or later
2. Build and run (F5)

#### Using Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to any sample directory containing a .csproj or .vbproj file
cd [sample_directory]
dotnet build
dotnet run [arguments]
```

Most console samples expect arguments in this format:
```bash
dotnet run <image_or_video_path> <country_id> [product_key]
```

Example:
```bash
dotnet run parking_lot.jpg 82 license.xml  # 82 = Spain
```

The GUI applications can be run without arguments and provide interactive interfaces.

### üêç Running Python Samples

1. Install SimpleLPR from PyPI:
```bash
pip install SimpleLPR
```

2. Navigate to the Python samples directory and explore the available examples:
```bash
cd [python_samples_directory]
python [sample_name].py
```

Most Python samples include built-in help and usage instructions. Run them without arguments to see available options.

### üè∑Ô∏è Country Codes

SimpleLPR supports license plates from approximately 90 countries. Here are some commonly used ones:

| ID | Country | ID | Country | ID | Country | ID | Country |
|----|---------|----|---------|----|---------|----|---------| 
| 5  | Austria | 16 | Canada  | 32 | France  | 45 | Italy   |
| 8  | Belgium | 19 | Colombia| 34 | Germany | 63 | Netherlands |
| 12 | Brazil  | 28 | Ecuador | 41 | India   | 71 | Poland  |
| 14 | Cambodia| 30 | Estonia | 43 | Ireland | 82 | Spain   |
| 15 | Cameroon| 31 | Finland | 44 | Israel  | 90 | UK-GreatBritain |

**Special Templates:**
- IDs 97-102: Numerical recognition (3-8 digits)
- ID 46: Italy-Moped, ID 47: Italy-Vintage
- ID 50: Kemler Code (hazardous materials)

Run any sample without arguments to see the complete list of all supported countries.

## Key Features Demonstrated
