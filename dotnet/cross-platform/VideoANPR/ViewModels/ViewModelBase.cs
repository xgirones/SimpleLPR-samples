Features:
- ANPR Processing: VideoANPR utilizes the SimpleLPR ANPR library to perform automatic number plate recognition on video streams.
- Video Capture: The application uses Emgu.CV as a third-party library for video capture, providing a simple and convenient way
  to process video frames. However, it can be easily replaced with any other compatible library if desired.
- Multi-platform User Interface: VideoANPR utilizes Avalonia and ReactiveUI to provide a cross-platform user interface,
  enabling the application to run on both Windows and Linux systems seamlessly.

Requirements:
- .NET Core SDK 6.0 or higher
- SimpleLPR ANPR library
- Emgu.CV (or alternative third-party library for video capture)
- Avalonia and ReactiveUI
